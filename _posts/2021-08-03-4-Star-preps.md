# 4 Redo Sea Star Library Preps and Combine and Concentration

*Copy of Original Post from Maggie Schedl* [Link to Original](https://meschedl.github.io/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/2021-08-03/4-Star-preps)

**Using 1/4th reactions of the [KAPA HyperPrep DNA Library Prep Kit](https://sequencing.roche.com/en-us/products-solutions/by-category/library-preparation/dna-library-preparation/kapa-hyperprep.html)**

**Samples are already sonicated**

### End Repair and A-tailing

- Prepared end repair and a-tailing master mix on ice:
  - ERAT buffer 1.75μl * 4.5 = 7.875μl
  - ERAT enzyme 0.75μl * 4.5 = 3.375μl
- Made 4 PCR strip tubes each with 12.5μl of 100ng sheared DNA
- Added 2.5μl of ERAT master mix to each sample
- Vortexed and spun down
- Placed samples in thermocyler A-tailing program in JONP login (~ 1 hour)

### Adapter Ligation

- Prepared ligation master mix on ice (**no vortexing of the ligase**):
  - ligation buffer 7.5μl * 4.5 = 33.75μl
  - DNA ligase 2.5μl * 4.5 = 11.25μl
  - nuclease free water 1.25μl * 4.5 = 5.625μl
- Added 11.25ul ligation master mix to each sample.  
- Added 1.25ul of planned adapter to each sample (see below). Adapters were added last to minimize adapter-adapter ligation

|Library Number|Adapter Number|
|----|----|
|14|2|
|34|10|
|37|1|
|45|9|

- Pipetted all samples up and down with the multichannel and spun down
- Incubated on the shaker at room temp for 1-2 hours at 200rpm

### 0.8X Cleanup

- Made fresh 80% EtOH
- Took KAPA Pure Beads out of fridge beforehand to warm to room temp
- After incubation at RT, added 22μl of KAPA pure beads to each sample and pipetted up and down at least 10 times to mix beads careful to avoid bubbles
- Placed tubes on shaker at room temp for 15 minutes
- Placed tubes on magnet plate and removed supernatant from tubes when it was fully clear not disturbing the beads
- Added 200μl of 80% EtOH to each tube while still the magnet not disturbing the beads
- Removed supernatant from each tube on the magnet plate without disturbing the beads
- Added 200μl of 80% EtOH to each tube while still the magnet not disturbing the beads
- Removed ALL the supernatant from each tube on the magnet plate without disturbing the beads. Extra EtOH blobs were removed with p20 pipette tips
- Resuspended beads in 6μl 10mM Tris HCl pH 8 and incubated tubes on shaker for 5 minutes
- Placed tubes back onto the magnet stand and removed 5ul supernatant when clear to new labeled PCR strip tubes

### Library Amplification

- Added 6.25ul KAPA HiFi to each sample tube
- Added 0.75ul 503 and 0.75ul 703 to 14
- Added 0.75ul 504 and 0.75ul 704 to 34
- Added 0.75ul 505 and 0.75ul 705 to 37
- Added 0.75ul 505 and 0.75ul 705 to 45
- Vortexed and spun down samples
- Placed in the thermocyler Genomic PCR 6 program

### 2 1X Cleanups

- After PCR, added 12.5μl of KAPA pure beads to each sample and pipetted up and down at least 10 times to mix beads careful to avoid bubbles
- Placed tubes on shaker at room temp for 15 minutes
- Placed tubes on magnet plate and removed supernatant from tubes when it was fully clear not disturbing the beads
- Added 200μl of 80% EtOH to each tube while still the magnet not disturbing the beads
- Removed supernatant from each tube on the magnet plate without disturbing the beads
- Added 200μl of 80% EtOH to each tube while still the magnet not disturbing the beads
- Removed ALL the supernatant from each tube on the magnet plate without disturbing the beads. Extra EtOH blobs were removed with p20 pipette tips
- Resuspended beads in 13μl 10mM Tris HCl pH 8 and incubated tubes on shaker for 5 minutes
- Placed tubes back onto the magnet stand and removed 12.5ul supernatant when clear to new labeled PCR strip tubes
- Added 12.5μl of KAPA pure beads to each sample and pipetted up and down at least 10 times to mix beads careful to avoid bubbles
- Placed tubes on shaker at room temp for 15 minutes
- Placed tubes on magnet plate and removed supernatant from tubes when it was fully clear not disturbing the beads
- Added 200μl of 80% EtOH to each tube while still the magnet not disturbing the beads
- Removed supernatant from each tube on the magnet plate without disturbing the beads
- Added 200μl of 80% EtOH to each tube while still the magnet not disturbing the beads
- Removed ALL the supernatant from each tube on the magnet plate without disturbing the beads. Extra EtOH blobs were removed with p20 pipette tips
- Resuspended beads in 16μl 10mM Tris HCl pH 8 and incubated tubes on shaker for 5 minutes
- Placed tubes back onto the magnet stand and removed 15ul supernatant when clear to new labeled PCR strip tubes

### QC

- Followed [Qubit protocol for BR DNA](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)

|Library Number | Library Concentration|
|----|----|
|14|2.58|
|34|23.8|
|37|20.5|
|45|13|

**These weren't great quantifications. I decided to combine the old and new libraries, concentrated them down to 16ul again, and qubit again.**

- Combined all 3 attempts of library 14, and the 2 attempts of 34, 37, and 45
- Added either 40ul (14) or 30ul of KAPA pure beads to each tube (roughly 1X for all tubes) and pipette mixed
- Placed tubes on shaker at room temp for 15 minutes
- Placed tubes on magnet plate and removed supernatant from tubes when it was fully clear not disturbing the beads
- Added 200μl of 80% EtOH to each tube while still the magnet not disturbing the beads
- Removed supernatant from each tube on the magnet plate without disturbing the beads
- Added 200μl of 80% EtOH to each tube while still the magnet not disturbing the beads
- Removed ALL the supernatant from each tube on the magnet plate without disturbing the beads. Extra EtOH blobs were removed with p20 pipette tips
- Resuspended beads in 16μl 10mM Tris HCl pH 8 and incubated tubes on shaker for 5 minutes
- Placed tubes back onto the magnet stand and removed 15ul supernatant when clear to new labeled PCR strip tubes
- Followed [Qubit protocol for BR DNA](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)

|Library Number | Library Concentration|
|----|----|
|14|5.3|
|34|27.8|
|37|29|
|45|18.7|

- I decided these were good enough

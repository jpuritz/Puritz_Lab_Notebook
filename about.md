I use molecular tools to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes of marine populations. Currently, my research focuses on using next-generation sequencing and genomics to understand how human populations affect connectivity and evolution in the ocean. I study a variety of organisms, from fish to sea stars.

I am dedicated to open, rigorous, and reproducible experiments and analyses.
